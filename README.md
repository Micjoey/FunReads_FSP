### Key Features

   * User Authorization 
   * Books
   * Reviews
   * Shelves
   
Users are able to sign up an account, or use the demo login, and instantly start adding books to their pre-constructed shelves. Users are able to see all reviews for a book and who gave the review when looking at an individual book. While on the individual book you are able to see all the shelves it exists on, as well as add it to any shelf that exists, in addition you can create a new shelf from that view. Future functions that I wish to add to the book show page are:
  * the ability to edit and add reviews
  * mark as read

The My Books tab on the nav bar will take you to your shelf view which will allow a user to see all shelves that they have, and all books that exist on that shelf. From this view you are able to delete or create a shelf. Future functions that I wish to add to the shelf are:
  * Delete a book off a shelf
  * Filter through the shelves
